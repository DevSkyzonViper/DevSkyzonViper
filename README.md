Oh someone did come here, to read my github profile
Ehh. I guess I will say some shit.

Sooooo. Im just a guy that makes some programs go brrrr.

I mostly write in C/C++ (im a masochist ig) and if I need to, I will use Java or web-languages.

Here are the following tools I use:
 - Visual Studio Code (obviously)
 - Git (okay that it really obvious)
 - Obsidian for notes and diagrams

Thats basically it.

And if you want to reach me, here is my discord:
skyzonviper.

(Yes, with the dot)

Uhhhh.. yeah bye or something.
